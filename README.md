# Advent of Code 2023

This repo contains my solutions for the 2023 "Advent of Code" competition. All solutions are written in Python.

Each folder probably only contains the solution for the second part of that day, since I simply modify the code for part 1 to solve part 2 without backup. So if you're looking for solutions of day 1, you're SOL.
